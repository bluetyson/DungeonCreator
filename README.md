DungeonCreator
==============

python dungeon creator based on AD&amp;D DMG random dungeon generator

Code for my senior project.  Please don't hurt me.

Instructions:
-------------
This project assumes you have python.  I wrote it in python2.7.  If it works in anything else, fantastic.
I use the module PythonMegaWidgets (http://pmw.sourceforge.net/) to handle hovertext for the monster tiles,
so please install that if you wish to run my code.

With that installed, I have this running on both windows 7 and mac osx 10.6.
